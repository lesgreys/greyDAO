# What is GREY?

GREY is an aspirational “experiment” to re-index the fashion economy on-chain. While projects such as Nouns are attempting to bootstrap identity, community, governance, and a treasury to be used by the community. GREY attempts to drill a little lower, bootstrapping fashion houses, designers, creators, influencers, seamstresses , pattern-makers, interns, manufacturers, and more. 

Proliferate the fashion economy by funding and helping creators develop brands and lifestyles in fashion, contributing to the growth of the GREY Ecosystem.
