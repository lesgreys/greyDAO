In a digitally-native world, GREY believes, location is a way of the past, and decentralization is the future. Fashion must propagate its global brand by bringing a more creative spirit that is unbound by borders and central organizations.

This organization is not the aspirations of any one individual. Instead, itâ€™s the aspirations of dozens, if not hundreds, thousands, or millions, in the fashion world.  

* A way to derive value and income from your wildest imaginations. 
* A way to feel liberated from the ideas of a central organization. 
* A way to own your work from start to finish.  
* A way too deeply connect to your culture, ideas, and your community. 

From anywhere around the world. Together. Autonomously. Co-creating.

So, why GREY? Because we want you to own all of you, from the skin on your back, to the fabric that wraps, to the culture that breathes life into us all. 

GREY is nothing, so you can be everything, in a decentralized fashion economy.
