# What is GREY?

Grey is an aspirational “experiment” to re-index the fashion economy on-chain. While projects such as Nouns are attempting to bootstrap identity, community, governance, and a treasury to be used by the community. Grey attempts to drill a little lower, bootstrapping designers, creators, influencers, seamstresses , pattern-makers, interns, manufacturers, and more. 

Proliferate the fashion economy by funding and helping creators making a living in fashion, while contributing through the GREY Ecosystem.
